  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction:</h2>

<p>In my journey through the BrowserHistory Web Development Workouts (WODs), I have gained valuable insights into the world of web development, honed my skills in HTML and CSS, and developed a deeper understanding of web development tools like VS Code, LiveReload, and Chrome Developer Tools. These WODs challenged me to approach web development with practice and continuous improvement. In this essay, I will summarize my experiences with each of the three WODs, highlighting what I learned, how long it took to complete each one, and any setbacks I encountered.</p>

<h2 id="wod-31">WOD 3.1:</h2>

<p>For my first WOD, I was tasked with creating a simple static web page. This assignment introduced me to the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. It took me approximately 2 hours to complete and I had to do it about 3 times. The key takeaways from this exercise were:</p>

<p>HTML Structure: I learned how to structure a web page using HTML tags, including headings, paragraphs, and a table of contents. Properly nesting these elements was crucial for creating a well-organized page.</p>

<p>VS Code Usage: Working with VS Code, I became more proficient in code editing, file management, and the use of extensions for enhanced productivity.</p>

<p>LiveReload: LiveReload proved to be a game-changer, as it allowed me to see real-time updates to my webpage as I made changes to the code, greatly improving my development workflow.</p>

<p>Persistence: This assignment taught me the value of persistence and patience when dealing with complex web layouts. It required multiple attempts to get the responsive design just right.</p>

<h2 id="wod-2">WOD 2:</h2>

<p>The second WOD challenged me to create definitions in the styles.css page. This WOD was fairly easier than the previous one and took me about an hour to complete. Here’s what I learned:</p>

<p>CSS Styling: This WOD builds upon the CSS knowledge gained in previous exercises. It reinforces the importance of using CSS to control the presentation and styling of web content. By creating a separate “style.css” file and linking it to the HTML document, I learned how to organize and manage CSS styles efficiently.</p>

<p>Typography Control: The WOD instructs me to define specific fonts for headings and non-heading text. This highlights the importance of typography in web design and how CSS allows for precise control over font selection.</p>

<p>Color Management: By setting the font color to “DarkBlue” and the background color to “Ivory,” I learned how to manipulate colors effectively using CSS properties. This knowledge can be applied to create visually appealing and cohesive web designs.</p>

<p>Margin and Text Width: The instructions specify margins for top, bottom, left, and right, as well as a text width of 950px. This reinforces the concept of layout control in CSS, allowing for the precise positioning and sizing of elements on the web page.</p>

<p>Inline Images: The requirement to have logos inline with text underscores the importance of controlling the placement and alignment of images within the content. This is a valuable skill for creating visually pleasing and organized web layouts.</p>

<p>Resource Utilization: The instructions suggest studying CSS tutorials and Google Web Fonts links in the Resources section before starting the WOD. This highlights the importance of utilizing external resources and documentation to enhance one’s web development skills.</p>

<p>Chrome Developer Tools: My understanding of Chrome Developer Tools expanded as I used it to test and debug the responsive design, checking for layout issues and adjusting CSS accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="wod-3">WOD 3:</h2>

<p>The third WOD pushed me to organize the web page to make a more user-friendly design. This WOD was also fairly easy, taking approximately one hour and a half to complete. My key takeaways were:</p>

<p>Organization and Directory Management: Creating a dedicated directory for the new WOD (BrowserHistory3) is essential for maintaining an organized project structure. This practice makes it easier to manage files and keep track of progress.</p>

<p>File Transfers: Copying files (index.html and style.css) from a previous project to the current one demonstrates the reuse of existing code. This practice is essential for efficiency and maintaining consistent design elements across multiple pages or sections of a website.</p>

<p>Responsive Design: The main task of changing the layout to display three columns side-by-side (each 300px wide) and creating a navigation bar showcases the importance of responsive web design. It’s crucial to ensure that web pages look and function well on various devices and screen sizes.</p>

<p>CSS Styling: Styling elements like the navigation bar and adjusting the layout require a good understanding of CSS. This exercise highlights the significance of CSS in web development and the ability to apply styles effectively to achieve the desired design.</p>

<h2 id="setbacks-and-improvements">Setbacks and Improvements:</h2>

<p>During this journey, I encountered several setbacks, including debugging challenges. These experiences taught me to
Manage my time by setting clear goals and time limits for each task. I learned to break down assignments into manageable chunks and allocate sufficient time for testing and debugging. I also learned to no hesitate to seek assistance from peers or online resources when facing roadblocks. Collaboration and learning from others’ experiences were invaluable. Lastly, I learned to embrace my mistakes. Mistakes and failures are part of the learning process. Instead of becoming frustrated, I learned to view them as opportunities for growth and improvement.</p>

<p>In conclusion, my BrowserHistory WOD journey was a rewarding experience that allowed me to develop practical skills in web development. It emphasized the importance of continuously practicing and improving. Through these exercises, I gained a solid foundation in HTML and CSS, as well as a deeper appreciation for the tools and techniques that streamline web development. I encourage my classmates to approach web development with dedication, patience, and a commitment to learning from every challenge they encounter.</p>
